			<p> In collaboration with <a target="_blank"href='http://bitsxbites.com/'class ='link'>Bits x Bites</a>, the first Food+Tech accellerator in China, I started a research around the topic of AI and cooking. </br>
			</br> Most future visions of the kitchen tend to show cooking as an issue to solve and use intelligence as a way to automate task and bring us as far from cooking as possible. What we were very interested in was to look at those more subtle ways in which intelligence
				could fit and enhance the experience the kitchen. <span id='highlight'> Rather than automating and replacing humans, What new interactions can we discover by using the best of both working together?</span></p>

				<p> The project started as an open research, combining <span id="highlight">a mix of immersive experiences in restaurants and kitchens as well as early explorations of Machine Learning and generative tools.</span></p>
				<p> We focused our research less in the act of cooking, but more into the other cognitive tasks that happen around it. Actions like finding new ideas for combinations or ingredients, making estimations of quantities or fixing on the fly a recipe.</br>
				All this soft knowledge is often uncaptured and remains in the head of chefs. What if we could record the culinary identity of a chef, beyond what you can find in recipe books?</p>

				<p> <span id="highlight"> We ran experiements with 5 chefs around the world</span> to act as if they were an artificial intelligence in a software. In shared docs sessions each of them would suggest and autocomplete recipes, food combinations and tips for cooking on
